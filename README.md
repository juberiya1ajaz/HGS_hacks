# We'TheWomen

## 💡 Inspiration

To provide a safer space for women and girls where they can communicate, collaborate, create their magic, and land their dream job, Our team came up with the idea of **We'TheWomen**. On our website, users can collaborate with their peers to create something unique and show it to their whole community. You can also write daily blogs on our website. The best part about our website is the Job posting page where you can see all the current openings of the different firms and apply according to the required skills. This application was inspired by women worldwide who could not access a safe virtual circle with all career amenities.

We have built a website using Velo by Wix. Wix Velo is a full-stack development platform that allows you to create a website from scratch, without any coding knowledge. It is a great tool for beginners who want to learn how to code, and for experienced developers who want to build a website quickly. Using Velo we can create a website in a matter of minutes, and we can also add custom JavaScript code to the website to make it more interactive. We are using Velo's built-in **database to store our data**, and we are using the JavaScript API to access the data.
